# Problem & Motivation
During written exams, teachers cannot constantly monitor every student; unauthorized student access, unallocated seat occupying, and subtle cheating (looking at neighbors, using hidden phones) remain problems. A compact desk-attached system that enforces seat assignment and detects suspicious movement/light signatures can assist proctoring.

---

# Objective
Build a cost-efficient sensor-based prototype smart desk that (1) ensures only the authorized student can unlock and sit at a dedicated desk using RFID technology; and (2) during the exam, detects and signals to the teacher when a student looks left/right/front/back beyond a set distance or uses a concealed phone under the desk.

---

# System Architecture
Two subsystems (modules).

### A. Student Access Control Subsystem:
This subsystem ensures that only the assigned student can use a particular desk.
- A green LED remains lit to indicate that the system is active.
- Input: Student ID scanned via RFID reader.
- Processing: Arduino compares the scanned ID against a list of valid IDs stored in memory.
- Outputs:
   - Valid ID:
     - A short buzzer beep with low sound.
     - System status green LED will be off, and another blue LED will be lit to indicate valid access.
     - LCD display shows “Access Granted: [Student ID]”.
     - Servo motor unlocks the desk for a limited time, then locks it again automatically.
   - Invalid ID:
     - A longer buzzer beep.
     - System status green LED will be off, and another red LED will be lit to indicate unauthorized access.
     - LCD display shows “Access Denied!!”.
     - Servo remains locked.
- The LCD is placed on the teacher’s desk so supervisors can monitor student entry and exit in real time.
- Status LEDs, servo, and the RFID scanner are placed on the student's desk.

### B. Cheating Detection Subsystem:
This subsystem continuously monitors student behaviour during the exam to detect potential cheating.
- Inputs:
     - Two ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04): Detect left and right head movements.
     - Two IR obstacle sensors: Detect forward and backward leaning.
     - One LDR sensor: Detects abnormal brightness under the desk, such as a hidden mobile phone.
     - Processing: Arduino checks all sensor values against predefined thresholds. If a threshold is crossed, it identifies the direction or activity of the suspicious behaviour.
- Outputs:
     - A buzzer sound (short alert) to immediately notify the teacher.
     - A common LED and a corresponding LED (left, right, front, back, or phone indicator) lights up on the teacher’s desk.
     - LEDs remain lit slightly longer than the buzzer sound, allowing the teacher to identify both which student was flagged and what type of behaviour was detected.
       
This subsystem ensures that cheating attempts are quickly recognized without the need for cameras, making it privacy-friendly and cost-effective.
